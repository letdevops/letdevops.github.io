					<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
					<p><strong>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</strong><br />
						Welcome to ItPost. ItPost LLC and/or its affiliates (hereafter “ItPost”),
						provides a service to you, subject to the following Terms of Service (“TOS”), which may be
						updated by us from time to time without notice to you. In addition, when using particular ItPost services, you shall be subject to any posted
						guidelines or rules applicable to such services which may be posted from time to time. All such
						guidelines or rules (including but not limited to our Spam Policy) are hereby incorporated by
						reference into the TOS.</p>
					<p><strong>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</strong><br />
						ItPost allows customers to search for and purchase trading signals, trading strategies, and
						trading newsletters, and information and analysis about this data. In addition, ItPost
						allows vendors of these products to find new customers and to distribute material to them. You
						also understand and agree that the Service may include advertisements and that these
						advertisements may be necessary for ItPost to provide the Service. You also understand and
						agree that the service may include certain communications from ItPost, such as service
						announcements and administrative messages, and that these communications are considered part of
						ItPost membership and you will not be able to opt out of receiving them. Unless explicitly
						stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the
						release of new ItPost properties, shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree
						that the Service is provided “AS-IS” and that ItPost assumes no responsibility for the
						timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or
						personalization settings.</p>
					<p>You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service and that access may involve third party
						fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges). You are responsible for those fees,
						including those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In addition, you
						must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service.</p>
					<p><strong>2A. NO FEE FOR PEOPLE SEARCHING FOR TRADING STRATEGIES.</strong><br />
						ItPost does not charge any fees to people who want to become members of the site, nor does
						it charge any fees to people who want to use the site to find trading strategies. Once a user
						finds a strategy to which he wants to subscribe, the user will be charged a monthly price which
						is set by the trading-strategy creator.</p>
					<p><strong>2B. FEE FOR SELLING TRADING STRATEGIES.</strong><br />
						If you provide trading strategies through ItPost and you successfully sell these strategies
						such that ItPost processes the transaction on your behalf, then ItPost charges a fee
						for each sale we conduct on your behalf. That fee is listed below in “Fee schedule.”</p>
					<p>The way we collect this fee is as follow. Each month, on a monthly cycle, we calculate how much
						we have collected on your behalf for transactions that are 45 days or older. We deduct a
						percentage of this amount as our fee, and we remit the rest back to you. We <u>do not</u> remove
						additional amounts for the standard credit card processing “discount rate.”</p>
					<p>Because of the risk of charge-backs, refunds, and unsatisfied customers, we remit your funds only
						after a transaction is 45 days old. However, we do remit on a monthly cycle. This means,
						essentially, that your first remittance from us may take over a month to arrive, but once you
						receive your first remittance, you will receive new remittances each month.</p>
					<p><strong>Fee schedule.</strong> Our fee is 50% of the transaction amount.</p>
					<p><strong>Refunds and exceptional charges.</strong> If your subscriber is unhappy and demands a
						refund of fees paid to us on your behalf, or if an unhappy customer calls his bank and as a
						result we are charged a special fee – called a “chargeback” in credit card jargon – then we will
						remove that fee from your next remittance amount or any future remittance amount until this fee
						has been repaid. Thus we encourage you, as a strategy vendor, to strive to satisfy your
						subscriber customers.<br />
						ItPost is charged by its merchant processing service a percentage of each transaction
						amount, even if the amount is eventually refunded. We are also charged a percentage of the
						refund amount. Thus, we pass these costs along to you. If your customers demands and receives a
						refund, we will charge you a refund fee based on the initial transaction amount. That refund fee
						is 7.5% of the initial charge. We therefore encourage you to provide excellent customer service
						to your subscribers so that your refunds are kept to a minimum. All refunds and fees may be
						charged against current or future remittances that we owe you. If the amount of refunds that we
						pay out on your behalf exceeds the fees that we collect on your behalf, we may at our discretion
						bill your credit card for the amount we are unable to debit from your ItPost account in
						order to cover the cost of any refunds we have paid to your customers.</p>
					<p><strong>2C. How we handle your customers’ asking for refunds.</strong> It is our policy to refund
						money to system subscribers when they express unhappiness. Indeed, we are often forced to do so
						by our credit card processing companies and associated banks. Any amount refunded to your
						subscribers will be deducted from future remittance cycles. If you do not have a large enough
						balance to cover the refund amount and associated fees, then you agree that ItPost will
						charge your credit card for the amount we are owed but which your balance at ItPost does
						not cover.</p>
					<p><strong>2D. Credit risk. </strong>Finally, we are not in the business of bearing exceptional
						credit card risk on your behalf. Therefore, if your subscription amounts become large enough
						that we would bear a risk of substantial loss should your system suddenly stop performing, or if
						your system stops performing suddenly, we reserve the right to withhold any amount of your
						remittance until we deem that the risk of large customer refunds has passed. We may not hold any
						amount longer than 95 days after the transaction date.</p>
					<p><strong>2E. Remittance of funds.</strong> We remit your money electronically through PayPal or
						other electronic transfer methods. If you live in a country where PayPal is unavailable, we will
						negotiate an alternative payment method for you. There may be an additional fee for these
						non-standard or non-electronic payment methods. You are responsible for all fees charged to you
						by Paypal or the alternate payment mechanism.</p>
					<p><strong>2F. Listing Fees. </strong>In addition, we charge an Listing Fee for each trading system
						you offer and maintain on the ItPost site. In some cases, you will have a chance to
						experiment with the ItPost site for a limited period of time before we ask you to pay the
						Listing Fee. You may choose not to pay the Listing Fee, in which case you will not be able to
						maintain your system on ItPost. We encourage vendors to maintain multiple trading systems
						on ItPost. Thus, we charge one amount for the first system you add, and a reduced amount
						for subsequent systems added within three months of the first system. Our Listing Fee schedule
						is found on our prices page.</p>
					<p>Listing Fees are paid up-front, and are non-refundable. This means that even if you stop
						maintaining your trading system, stop using our Web site, or “kill” your trading system, no
						portion of the listing fee is refundable. You may not transfer your listing fee from one system
						to another.</p>
					<p><strong>3. YOUR OBLIGATIONS</strong></p>
					<p><b>3A. </b><b><a name="nosolicit"></a></b><b></b><b>SYSTEM DEVELOPERS: YOUR OBLIGATION NOT TO
							SOLICIT CUSTOMERS AWAY FROM ItPost</b></p>
					<p>ItPost spends a large amount of money marketing to consumers and attracting them to the
						site, where they can subscribe to trading strategies like yours and thus pay you money. When
						they pay you, ItPost charges you a fee for our service. From our perspective, ItPost
						invests a large amount of money up front each time we attract a new customer to your trading
						strategy, which we hope to make back (and eventually a profit) over the customer’s lifetime.</p>
					<p>There is a natural temptation for strategy vendors to use ItPost to find new customers (and
						to allow ItPost to bear the cost of customer acquisition), but then to “transition” the
						customer to an alternate venue where he can pay you directly, without your incurring ItPost
						fees. We prohibit this. What does this mean, concretely? First, you are welcome to offer your
						trading system on sites other than ItPost. We also welcome you to run your own Web site
						independently of ItPost. That said, if you pursue either of those strategies, we ask you
						not to overtly or implicitly solicit ItPost customers and ask them to move their
						subscriptions to alternative platforms, where subscriptions or payments would be processed
						outside of ItPost’s control. Second, if you <i>do</i> offer your strategy elsewhere, you
						may not offer it for a lower price at another venue (or, alternatively, you may not tack on a
						fee for ItPost subscribers). Third, while you are welcome to sell your system from as many
						Web sites or through as many channels as you like,<u> we ask that you do not advertise those
							other channels from the ItPost Web site</u>. That means, if you run a Web site
						independent of ItPost, and your Web site allows subscriptions or offers services outside of
						ItPost (such as “a managed account”) you may not include a link to that Web site, or
						implicitly advertise that Web site anywhere on ItPost (including your system description on
						ItPost, your forums on ItPost, or public/private messages to ItPost subscribers).
						Any of these activities are either subtle or overt ways to encourage customers found for you by
						ItPost to migrate away from ItPost.</p>
					<p>The purpose of these rules is to allow you to market to customers in as many places as you like,
						and to give you freedom to to reach as many customers as you possibly can… but to require that
						you be fair and not “poach” customers acquired by ItPost on your behalf. If you have any
						questions about this, please contact us by email so that we can avoid misunderstandings and
						conflict. Our goal is to make ItPost so great that you will have little desire to offer
						your trading strategy elsewhere. But, should you desire to offer your strategy elsewhere, we
						will certainly allow this, providing the playing field is fair.</p>
					<p>If you violate any of these provisions, we may temporarily or permanently suspend your account,
						prevent your system from being viewed by the public, or take whatever steps we deem necessary to
						protect the viability of ItPost. We will not issue any refunds – in whole or in part – if
						we suspend your system for violation of these Terms of Service.</p>
					<p><b>3B. SOLICITATION OF STRATEGIES AND STRATEGY DEVELOPERS</b></p>
					<p>Registered hedge funds, CTAs, mutual funds, investment advisors, or asset managers with over $10
						million in AUM may request permission to use this site to find employees or consultants. To use
						the site in this way, ItPost charges a fee for this service, which is 20% of the new-hire’s
						first-year total compensation (minimum of $4,000 per hire). We rely on users to report their use
						of this site for recruiting and hiring purposes. You may not solicit strategy developers for any
						purpose unless you first request permission to do so and receive permission. Note that we also offer a fixed-fee
						program which greatly reduces the cost of such recruiting. Please contact us to learn more.</p>
					<p><b>No solicitation of strategies or strategy-developers without permission</b></p>
					<p>We prohibit users of this service to solicit strategies or strategy developers, unless you have
						requested permission (above) or are part of our fixed-fee program.</p>
					<p>In addition, we prohibit users of this service to solicit members to alternate competitive
						services. This includes (but is not limited to) soliciting strategy developers to make their
						systems available at brokers or trading services outside the ItPost platform. If you
						violate this policy, ItPost reserves the right to take legal action to recover lost
						revenues you have stolen from us, plus applicable damages. By using ItPost, you
						specifically acknowledge that you agree to this prohibition. Brokers should instead contact us
						about mutually beneficial partnerships.</p>
					<p><strong><strong>3C. GENERAL REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS</strong><br />
						</strong>In consideration of your use of the Service, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate,
						current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service’s registration form
						(such information being the “Subscription Form”) and (b) maintain and promptly update the
						Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any
						information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or ItPost has reasonable
						grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete,
						ItPost has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or
						future use of the Service (or any portion thereof).<strong><br />
						</strong><br />
						<strong><strong>4. ITPOST’s PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br />
						</strong><br />
						Registration Data and certain other information about you is subject to our Privacy Policy. For
						more information, see our full privacy policy at <a href="policy.html"
							target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://itpost.com/privacy.</a></p>
					<p><strong><strong>5. MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY</strong><br />
						</strong><br />
						You will receive a password and account designation upon completing the Service’s registration
						process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account,
						and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You
						agree to (a) immediately notify ItPost of any unauthorized use of your password or account
						or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of
						each session. ItPost cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your
						failure to comply with this Section 5.<strong><br />
						</strong><br />
						<strong><strong>6. MEMBER CONDUCT</strong><br />
						</strong><br />
						You understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics,
						video, messages or other materials (“Content”), whether publicly posted or privately
						transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated. This
						means that you, and not ItPost, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload,
						post, email, transmit or otherwise make available via the Service. ItPost does not control
						the Content posted via the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or
						quality of such Content. You understand that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content
						that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will ItPost be liable
						in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, for any errors or omissions in any
						Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content
						posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service.</p>
					<p>You agree to not use the Service to intentionally or unintentionally violate any applicable
						local, state, national or international law, including, but not limited to, regulations
						promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading
						Commission (CFTC), any rules of any national or other securities exchange, including, without
						limitation, the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ, and any
						regulations having the force of law.</p>
					<p>You acknowledge that ItPost does not pre-screen Content, but that ItPost and its
						designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to refuse or
						move any Content that is available via the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, ItPost
						and its designees shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the TOS or is
						otherwise objectionable. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with,
						the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of
						such Content.</p>
					<p>You acknowledge and agree that ItPost may preserve Content and may also disclose Content if
						required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is
						reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the TOS; (c) respond to
						claims that any Content violates the rights of third-parties; or (d) protect the rights,
						property, or personal safety of ItPost, its users and the public.</p>
					<p>You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including your
						Content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and
						adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.<strong><br />
						</strong><br />
						<strong><strong>7. SPECIAL ADMONITIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL USE</strong><br />
						</strong><br />
						Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules
						regarding online conduct and acceptable Content. Specifically, you agree to comply with all
						applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or
						the country in which you reside.</p>
					<p><strong><strong>8. CONTENT SUBMITTED OR MADE AVAILABLE FOR INCLUSION ON THE
								SERVICE</strong><br />
						</strong>ItPost does not claim ownership of Content you submit or make available for
						inclusion on the Service. With respect to Content you submit or make available for inclusion on
						<u>publicly accessible</u> or <u>subscriber-accessible</u> areas of the Service, you grant
						ItPost a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to display such information. In addition,
						ItPost is permitted to include your strategy in aggregated data products in such a way
						which prevents your strategy from being individually identifiable, and in such a way which
						prevents anyone following your strategy on an individual per-strategy-basis without purchasing a
						real-time subscription through ItPost. Once you publish a trading signal through
						ItPost, or publish trading commentary or strategy broadcasts, ItPost shall be allowed
						to make this information available within its Web site or through any other means, in
						perpetuity.</p>
					<p>By using the site, you specifically acknowledge that you understand that ItPost may publicly
						evaluate your strategies, on its Web sites or through related marketing channels, including
						emails, social media, and printed material; and that the methods used to evaluate your
						strategies and trading style may include statistical analysis and/or personal judgements of
						officers, staff, and contractors; and that ItPost, its officers, staff, or contractors may
						comment and pass judgement on the fitness or quality of your strategy or the material you
						submit, including (but not limited to) your strategy methodology, trading record, or any other
						written or electronic media related to your strategy. In other words: remember this is a public
						Web site, and by submitting your system to this Web site, you accept that the trading strategy
						and/or you, the strategy manager, and/or your trading style, may be publicly evaluated.</p>
					<p>If you manage a trading strategy on ItPost, you agree that the system can be monitored, and
						its performance rated in any way seen fit by ItPost. These ratings may be published, or
						made publicly available. The general public may publish reviews of your strategy. While we try
						our best to make ratings, scores, and reviews as accurate and useful as possible, it is possible
						that we may issue incorrect ratings, and that a review not generated by ItPost may be
						flawed. Therefore you agree to hold harmless ItPost and its affiliates with regard to these
						ratings and reviews, regardless of whether the rating or review or analysis is calculated
						accurately or inaccurately.</p>
					<p><strong>9. INDEMNITY</strong><br />
						You agree to indemnify and hold ItPost, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents,
						and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by
						any third party due to or arising out of Content you submit, post, transmit or make available
						through the Service, your use of the Service, your connection to the Service, your violation of
						the TOS, or your violation of any rights of another.<strong><br />
						</strong><br />
						<strong><strong>10. NO RESALE OF SERVICE, NO RESALE OF SUBSCRIPTION</strong></strong><br />
						You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit for any commercial
						purposes, any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service. If you
						subscribe to a trading strategy, you agree not to forward, disseminate, or resell its contents
						without permission of the trading strategy provider.</p>
					<p><strong><strong>11. GENERAL PRACTICES REGARDING USE AND STORAGE</strong></strong><br />
						You acknowledge that ItPost may establish general practices and limits concerning use of
						the Service, including without limitation the maximum number of days that email messages,
						message board postings or other uploaded Content will be retained by the Service, the maximum
						number of email messages that may be sent from or received by an account on the Service, the
						maximum size of any email message that may be sent from or received by an account on the
						Service, the maximum disk space that will be allotted on ItPost’s servers on your behalf,
						and the maximum number of times (and the maximum duration for which) you may access the Service
						in a given period of time. You agree that ItPost has no responsibility or liability for the
						deletion or failure to store any messages and other communications or other Content maintained
						or transmitted by the Service. You acknowledge that ItPost reserves the right to log off
						accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time. You further acknowledge that
						ItPost reserves the right to change these general practices and limits at any time, in its
						sole discretion, with or without notice.</p>
					<p><strong><strong>12. MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICE<br />
							</strong></strong>ItPost reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify
						or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without
						notice. You agree that ItPost shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any
						modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.<strong><strong><br />
							</strong></strong><br />
						<strong><strong><strong>13. TERMINATION<br />
								</strong></strong></strong>You agree that ItPost may, <em>under certain
							circumstances and without prior notice</em>, immediately terminate your ItPost account
						and access to the Service. Cause for such termination shall include, but not be limited to, (a)
						breaches or violations of the TOS or other incorporated agreements or guidelines, (b) requests
						by law enforcement or other government agencies, (c) a request by you (self-initiated account
						deletions), (d) discontinuance or material modification to the Service (or any part thereof),
						(e) unexpected technical issues or problems, and (f) extended periods of
						inactivity.<strong><strong><strong><br />
								</strong></strong></strong></p>
					<p><strong><strong><strong><strong>14. LINKS</strong></strong></strong></strong><br />
						The Service may provide links to other World Wide Web sites or resources. Because ItPost
						has no control over such sites and resources, you acknowledge and agree that ItPost is not
						responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources, and does not endorse and
						is not responsible or liable for any Content, advertising, products, or other materials on or
						available from such sites or resources. You further acknowledge and agree that ItPost shall
						not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged
						to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such Content, goods or services
						available on or through any such site or resource.<strong><strong><strong><br />
								</strong></strong></strong><br />
						<strong><strong><strong><strong>15. ITPOST’S PROPRIETARY
										RIGHTS</strong></strong></strong></strong><br />
						You acknowledge and agree that the Service and any necessary software used in connection with
						the Service (“Software”) contain proprietary and confidential information that is protected by
						applicable intellectual property and other laws. You further acknowledge and agree that Content
						presented to you through the Service is protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks,

						the trading strategy vendors, you agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or
						create derivative works based on the Service or the material published through the Service, in
						whole or in part.</p>
					<p>You agree not to access the Service by any means other than through the interface that is
						provided by ItPost for use in accessing the Service.</p>

						full force and effect. References to sections are to sections of this Agreement, unless
						otherwise indicated. Section headings are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall
						not affect the construction of this Agreement. The singular number shall include the plural, and
